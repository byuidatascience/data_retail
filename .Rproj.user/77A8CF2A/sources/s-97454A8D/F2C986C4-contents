# Wrangled Energy Plus & TMY3 Data

This folder contains the wrangled Energy Plus data that is joined with the TMY3 data found in the `data_weather` repository for eight cities in the United States. The scripts that created this data can be found in the `EnergyPlus_TMY3_Wrangling` folder of this repository. These cities, contained in separate .csv files, include:

- Albuquerque, New Mexico
- Atlanta, Georgia
- Baltimore, Maryland
- Houston, Texas
- Los Angeles, California
- Phoenix, Arizona
- San Francisco, California
- Seattle, Washington

The wrangling primarily concerns removing unnecessary or redundant columns from the joined data and converting the units of measurement into kilowatts.
