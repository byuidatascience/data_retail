# data_retail

This is a repository for retail data, particularly for Energy Plus supermarket simulation data files of various cities. The data has been wrangled to a tidy state and is prepared for futher analysis.

The energy plus data has been joined with other TMY3 weather data that can be found in the `data_weather` repository. Copies of scripts that are compatable for both datasets can be found in this repository as well.
